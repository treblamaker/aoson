  <p id="intro"> Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Albert and I am an incoming 3rd year Mechanical Engineering major attending the University of California, Irvine. Through this portfolio/blog, I hope to exercise my creativity by improving on skills, old and new. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring my creativity in music (singing, piano, ukulele), playing video games, and educating myself on social justice issues in any way I can. </p>
  <p id="emph">Here, I will showcase my work of many things from photography from areas I have traveled to over the years to engineering experience that I have accumulated over the years.</p>
